# Version 2.0 The second version
So for the past the days I have been updating my game and fixing bugs. Here is the changelog:
- Stars system: Complete challenges for the 3 stars
- Boss mode: Survive 2 minutes from the falling boxes
- Protector mode: Save 100 boxes by hovering on them. You have 3 lives
- Extras menu
- Highscore system

There is also a slight problem in the code. I will try to fix it but the game just is freezing at some places.
But that is the changelog for today. Maybe I'll try to add a fourth star but we'll see!
Goodbye for now!

# Version 1.0 THE RELEASE
This is the first release of my game Box Dodge! I know it isn't original but it is my first project! Here are the main features:
- Main menu
- Score counting
- Dificulty chooser
- Increasing speeds
- And many more...

I am going to make some more updates so stay tuned!
